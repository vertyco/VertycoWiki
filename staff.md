# Golden Rules
The following points are a guidelines for how Moderators in Vertyco are expected to conduct themselves.

## Admit Uncertainty
Always admit if you don't know the answer. It's better to consult with another team member than to provide incorrect information.
## Impersonal Warnings
When warning a user, utilize statements like "We may have to mute you if this continues." Avoid using "I" to keep the focus on the standards, not the moderator.
## Minimize Mutes
Try to resolve issues without resorting to muting. Use it as a last resort.
## Professional Conduct
As representatives of Vertyco, moderators are expected to maintain a high standard of professional behavior. If you play PvP, you must be able to flip a switch to turn the professionalism on and off, trash talk is fine in PvP chats but outside of that keep it classy.
## Guiding Correct Behavior
Encourage proper protocol, such as using the ticket system instead of direct pings. Frame requests positively whenever possible. Instead of using the words "don't do this", try saying "please use the ticket system instead of pinging" for example. The please part is optional.
## Moderation Commands
Use staff commands ONLY in the mod channel to avoid command conflicts.
## Maintain Composure
Remain calm and professional, even when provoked. Consult with fellow staff members if unsure about taking action. In the case of a conflict of interest due to PvP drama, it is good practice to ask another staff member to step in.
## Ticket Etiquette
Always explain the reason when closing a ticket. Avoid interfering in conversations handled by other staff unless asked for help.
## PvP General Channel
If you are participating in PvP and get into altercations with someone, you MUST get another staff member not involved to handle any moderations that need to be performed!
