# Tribe Structure Compliance Procedure

- **Map the Structures**: Use `.structures <tribe_name_or_id>` to get a count and layout of the tribe's structures.
- **Documentation**: If `1000` or fewer structures are noted and placement is not excessively scattered, record this in the Tribe Notes channel. No direct messaging necessary unless scattering is an issue.
- **Compliance Check**: Remove any structures found to be in violation, such as being meshed or set as traps.
- **Excess Structures**: Should the tribe exceed `1000` structures or exhibit multiple bases, instruct the tribe to initiate a ticket with all their members included, giving them a `3-5 day period` to comply with structure limits.
- **Minimal Staff Involvement**: Limit ticket management to only one or two staff members to avoid overwhelming players and ensure a respectful approach is maintained.
- **Progress Updates**: Offer updated structure maps bi-daily or as requested by the tribe to guide their compliance efforts.
- **Final Assessment**: At the deadline, re-evaluate the compliance status to either close the ticket or plan further actions.
- **Conclusive Action**: Close the ticket if the tribe complies; if not, document the necessary actions, which may include extending deadlines or implementing server-enforced measures, while being respectful of the players' real-life free time.

*The goal is server optimization, not player inconvenience. If repeating steps due to non-compliance, do so respectfully, considering players' time and commitments.*
