Gamesharing is a feature that allows friends and family to share account content like games and DLC. This emulates the practice of trading physical copies of media to avoid having to purchase the same content multiple times.

When done by unrelated individuals in a server, this feature is now problematic. Not only does it go against the Terms of Service of every live service game platform, but it also raises concerns about account security risks and the potential for ban transfers. Any family or game sharing requests should be met with a <span style="color: orange;">ban</span>.
