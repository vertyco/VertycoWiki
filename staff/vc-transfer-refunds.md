# VC Transfer Refunds (SOP)

## Policy Summary
Accidental VC transfers are treated as user error and are **not** automatically reversed. Staff will only reverse a transfer when **all** eligibility requirements are met. If the recipient does not consent, staff will not force a reversal unless there is clear evidence of rule-breaking (e.g., scam, impersonation, or exploit).

> This protects innocent recipients, avoids disputes over “he said / she said,” and keeps the VC economy consistent.
> {.is-info}

## Eligibility for Reversal
All of the following must be true:

- The request is submitted within **24 hours** of the transfer.
- The transfer can be verified in logs (sender, recipient, amount, timestamp).
- The recipient has **not** spent or transferred the VC.
- The recipient **explicitly agrees** to return the VC **or** staff confirm the recipient account is inactive.

## Automatic Denials
Do **not** reverse if any of the following apply:

- The recipient refuses or is unresponsive after reasonable contact attempts.
- The VC has already been spent, gambled, or traded.
- The transfer was part of a trade, giveaway, wager, or agreement that went sour.
- The user is requesting repeated reversals (more than 1 in 90 days).

> If the recipient refuses, staff do not deduct VC from them unless there is clear evidence of misconduct.
> {.is-warning}

## Misconduct Exception
If evidence shows **scamming, impersonation, or coercion**, treat it as a rules violation. In those cases:

- Follow the applicable disciplinary steps in the Discord rules.
- Admins may reverse or wipe VC as part of enforcement, but **reversals without consent** are only allowed when the recipient account is confirmed inactive.

## Staff Procedure
1. **Collect details**
   - Sender ID, recipient ID
   - Amount, timestamp, and any message link
2. **Verify logs**
   - Confirm the transfer actually occurred
3. **Contact recipient**
   - Ask for confirmation and consent to return
4. **Reverse if eligible**
   - Use admin tools to adjust balances accordingly
5. **Document the ticket**
   - Record outcome, consent, and any actions taken

## Suggested Staff Response (Template)
> Thanks for reaching out. Accidental VC transfers aren’t automatically reversed. If the recipient agrees and the VC hasn’t been spent, we can reverse it. I’ll contact them and follow up with you.
