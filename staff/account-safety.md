# URLs

For any and all unknown links to sites, you should make use of a VPN in case of IP grabbers. Furthermore, you should also have an ad-blocker (such as uBlock Origin) to ensure you remain safe when checking links.

# Account Compromise

In the case of a compromising or deletion of your main account, you must immediately join on an alt and open a Ticket to notify the Staff team of the situation.
Other Safety
