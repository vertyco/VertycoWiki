# Policy
Protecting the privacy of our members and Staff is extremely important. Failure to do so compromises our entire server and operations.

Data should only be accessed on a need-to-know basis, and any potential security breaches or incidents must be reported promptly to Administration for immediate action.

Under no circumstances should any member share, leak, or disclose Staff or member data to external parties or unauthorized individuals.

> Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of Staff position. Or in severe cases, a ban from the server.

# Logs and Data

Staff members are provided access to logs that contain a large amount of data. These are to be used for moderation purposes only and never provided to any external users.

Members may not be provided the reasoning behind another user's ban or punishment. These are solely between the user and Staff.

User message logs may not be provided whether via cached or permanent logged form to any users except the exact person they originate from to provide assistance (e.g. Tickets).

  <summary>Explanation</summary>
  <p>For example, if a Ticket was opened by a user asking why they were warned, a message log of their own could be provided to assist in explaining and helping the user understand the situation.</p>
  <p>Another example, a Ticket is opened by a user asking for message logs that proves the validity of a ban of another user. This is not acceptable and a log will not be provided.</p>
