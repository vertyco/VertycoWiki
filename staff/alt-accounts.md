# Alt Accounts

Per the Moderations, Staff, and Alt Accounts policy, only one account per person is allowed in the server. However, under certain circumstances, users may join on an alternative account in an attempt to appeal or receive knowledge regarding their ban or appeal.

# Standard Penalties For Alt Accounts
- First offense
  - <span style="color: orange;">Ban</span> the alt.
  - Wipe the VC balance of the original account.
  - Wipe the Ark data of the original account.
- Second offense
  - <span style="color: orange;">Ban</span> the alt AND the original account.
  - If player was in a tribe by themselves wipe the tribe.
  
## Harboring Alt Accounts
Tribes that knowingly harbor alt accounts will face the following
- First offense
	- The person who recruited the alt will have their Ark data and VC wiped.
  		- If it is obvious who that other members knew about the alt, they will face the same VC/Data wipe.
	- Each of the other members will receive a warning stating that they are also responsible for their tribemates and will be held accountable should this continue.
- Second offense
	- The person who recruited the alt will be <span style="color: orange;">banned</span> along with a VC/Data wipe.
  - Each member of the tribe will receive a VC/Data wipe.
  	- Same applies here, if its obvious that other members know they will face the same punishment as the first point.


# Alt Account Appeal

All of the following conditions must be met in order for someone to appeal via an alt account through Tickets.
- The user has not utilized the server using their alt account (e.g. registered, already claimed VC).
- The alt account immediately engages with Staff about their appeal.
- The alt account was not in the server during the time their main account was also.

If these conditions are satisfied, the user can be engaged further as the Moderations, Staff, and Alt Accounts policy has not been fully violated in this exception. This means the account may have its ban appeal re-reviewed and (if decided upon) further consideration taken. If the conditions are NOT satisfied and they have been violated, the account is to be <span style="color: orange;">banned</span> for an Alt Account violation.

# Handling the Ticket

The Ticket to engage an alternative appeal is `.appeal`, which requires the following from the member:
1. Main account's ID and ban reason
2. Whether they have submitted an appeal through the appeal form on their main account.
3. Agreement that participating in the server with an alt account is a violation of the Alt Account policy and to not do so while the account is under review.

Since it is not possible for Staff without Extended Access to know whether the user has submitted an appeal, any further engagement (if conditions are satisfied) must be handled by someone with permissions to view ban appeals. (e.g. Vert, DonDarco or Vainne)

# Finalizing the Situation

If the user has not appealed, they will be requested to submit an appeal, the alt account must have a note added that it is an alt account, then kicked from the server.

If the ban appeal was decided upon and it is clear that the user will not be allowed back due to a gross violation of the rules, the alt account is to be <span style="color: orange;">banned</span> after receiving information that they will not be allowed back.
