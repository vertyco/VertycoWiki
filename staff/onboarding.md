# Prerequisites!
2FA is <span style="color: orange;">REQUIRED</span> on your Discord account before you can perform any moderation actions!

# Staff Purpose
The purpose of Staff is to maintain an advertisement, cheat, and drama free experience for the thousands of members in the server. Please take advantage of all the resources provided to you to easily integrate into our Staff team and become a successful Moderator.

# Trial Moderator
Trial Mods endure a two week period where their performance will be evaluated and ultimately decided upon whether you become full Staff or not. If you are ever unsure of anything, reach out to other Staff in the dedicated Staff communication channels.

# Moderation General
We cannot teach you how to be a good Moderator, it's expected that you have some sort of existent knowledge of the rules and will build upon them during your time here. Discord does however provide their own version of a [Moderator Academy via their website](https://discord.com/community-moderation-safety) you can reference for the basics.

When you make a mistake, notify other Staff immediately and be honest.

Members that have issues with the server or other members should open a ticket. Do not handle anything via direct messages or public channels, and do not play favorites. Everything is extensively logged.

Enforcing the rules by the book is important, but also important is the ability to use judgement on whether someone is acting in good faith. Use discretion, de-escalation, and do not be afraid to query your peers for decisions on moderation.

Power tripping or false punishments are unacceptable and may be met with removal from the Staff team depending on severity.
