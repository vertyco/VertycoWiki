# 🚫 Meshing & Cheating Procedures

Meshing and cheating is a broad category of exploitation in the game. Refer to the PvP Rules for the official tiered punishment system. This guide provides additional context for staff handling these situations.

## 📖 What Qualifies as a Meshed Structure?

A structure is considered **meshed** when **any** of the following conditions are met:
- Cannot be damaged by conventional means (C4, Rockets, Tek Rifle). **Tames do not count** as conventional means.
- Is fully under the texture of the map (fully hidden from normal view)

> Use this criteria when evaluating meshing reports. If a structure meets either condition, it qualifies as meshed.
