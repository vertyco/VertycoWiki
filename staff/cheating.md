# 🚫 Meshing & Cheating Procedures

Meshing and cheating is a broad category of exploitation in the game. We break it down into the following categories:

---

## 🏠 Meshed Bases

**Definition**: Entire bases built behind the mesh, usually with no legitimate entry method. Players typically use teleporters or Fjordhawks to transport items in and out.

### 🚨 Actions Required:
1. **Complete tribe wipe**
2. **For members NOT in Discord** (<span style="color: red;">with less than 30 days playtime</span>):
   - 24-hour warning via DM to join Discord, link account, open ticket, and read rules
   - Failure to comply results in <span style="color: orange;">**ban**</span>
3. **For members WITH linked Discord accounts**:
   - Immediate <span style="color: orange;">**ban**</span> - they should know better

---

## 🧱 Meshed Structures

**Definition**: Structures intentionally meshed to prevent players from building forward operating bases or claiming territory after being wiped.

### 🚨 Actions Required:
1. **Complete tribe wipe**
2. **For members NOT in Discord** (<span style="color: red;">with less than 30 days playtime</span>):
   - 24-hour warning via DM to join Discord, link account, open ticket, and read rules
   - Failure to comply results in <span style="color: orange;">**ban**</span>
3. **For members WITH linked Discord accounts**:
   - **First Offense**: One-time warning with VC and Data Wipe
   - **Second Offense**: <span style="color: orange;">**Ban**</span>

### 📸 Example:

## 📦 Meshed Loot Stashes

**Definition**: Any storage structure meshed to prevent destruction (commonly loadout dummies).

### Scenario 1: 🆔 Empty Stashes
- Delete structure
- Issue data wipe and VC wipe for each tribe member
- Formal warning issued

### Scenario 2: 📦 Stashes with Loot
1. **Complete tribe wipe**
2. **For members IN Discord**:
   - Ark data and VC wipe + formal warning
   - If in Discord longer than 30 days: <span style="color: orange;">**Ban**</span>
3. **For members NOT in Discord**:
   - Warning issued
   - 24 hours to join or be <span style="color: orange;">**banned**</span>

## 🛏️ Meshed Sleeping Bags

**Definition**: Sleeping bags or foundations with beds placed behind terrain. Usually attempts to access the mesh.

### 🚨 Actions Required:
- **For owners NOT in Discord**:
  - 24-hour warning via DM to link account and read rules
  - Failure to comply results in <span style="color: orange;">**ban**</span>
  - Official warning if they comply

  - One-time warning issued

## 🔫 Meshed Turrets

**Definition**: Turrets placed behind mesh to shoot players while remaining unreachable.

### 🚨 Actions Required:
Follow the same procedure as **Meshed Sleeping Bags** above.

---

## 🎈 Floating Turrets

**Definition**: Any turret not attached to ground structures, making it impossible to destroy the turret by destroying supporting structures.

### 🚨 Actions Required:
- **First Offense**:
  - Full structure wipe of the tribe
  - Wipe each tribe member's Ark data
  - Warning via Xbox DM command for each member
- **Second Offense**:
  - Another wipe
  - <span style="color: orange;">**Ban**</span> of all tribe members

### 📸 Example:
<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/floating-turret-example.png" alt="Floating turrets example" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" />
  <figcaption style="color: #b9bbbe;">These turrets are clearly floating with no supporting structures.</figcaption>
