Support tickets are one of the MAIN responsibilities of a Staff Member. As such, we want to try and resolve them in a timely but effective and professional manner.
Things to Determine Immediately

Upon a ticket being opened the following should be determined right away

- Is it for ASA or ASE and PvE or PvP? Some of this info is listed at the top of the ticket.
- If it involves a structure, dino, or player doing something, we will need the EXACT gps coordinates(34.1 57.9). General Map Coordinates(55 80) will not be enough. Obtain pertinent information "in a cave" or "in Asgard realm on Fjordur," or "underwater,"  information that may be necessary.
- Look at their reason stated for opening a ticket. If it involves replacing any lost items/dinos, or a tribe argument, or a ban appeal; then we will tell them in a polite manner that isn’t something Support Tickets are for.

# Interacting With Players
- For your first response to the player, make sure to either use REPLY to a message they sent in the ticket, or use the @ feature so they get pinged that someone is responding to their ticket.
- If another Staff Member is already in the ticket, do NOT join into the ticket.  Use the #Ticket-Discussion channel to talk with that Staff Member about the ticket. If you have additional info they need, you can say it there.  We want to avoid confusing players by having lots of staff responding with messages.
- Always remain professional.  If you have an issue with the player, or they are being disrespectful to you, stop responding and ask for another Staff Member to assist you.
- If the ticket is a PvP cheating issue, inform the player that their issue/concern will be investigated.  Make NO promises, and do not tell them you aren’t making promises.  Just keep it brief and simple, then involve others in Ticket-Discussion to find a resolution as a group.

The following types of scenarios may be encountered based off common Tickets:

- ✅ Questions about the server, be prepared to direct them to our resource pages for common questions.
- ✅ Reports about other users, make sure they have evidence.
- ❌ Suggestions, close and remind them to use the proper .suggest command
- ❌ Game or Strategy help. Tickets are for server issues only.

> You should not provide incorrect or "best guess" information to members. This not only looks bad for you, but misinforms the member, providing a subpar experience.

# Evidence, evidence, evidence.

When the Tickets are related to a user report, you must have evidence to issue a punishment. Hearsay is not evidence. Proper evidence is:

- ✅ A voice recording, with the discord overlay visible or at least good evidence the person speaking is who is causing the disruption.
- ✅ A screenshot of the violating behavior. If sketchy, a screen recording of them refreshing the discord client and showing the messages again (inspect element exists).
- ✅ If in-game, a video of the offending player breaking the rules.
- ❌ A claim by a member or group of members that someone did something is not evidence.

# Off-site behavior

Reports concerning direct messages, off-site conduct, or external servers are assessed individually, taking into account the nature and seriousness of the accusation, as well as the strength of evidence provided. Typically, instances of mild rudeness or derogatory behavior in DMs are recommended to be addressed by blocking and moving on, unless it starts to affect the server environment.

# How to Say No
> Unfortunately we cannot replace lost items.  We have no way of replicating exactly what was lost. If you ask around in the map-chats, there are friendly players who might be willing to help you with that.

> We understand being kicked out of your tribe is frustrating.  Unfortunately tribe affairs are not something we mediate and must be handled within the tribe itself.  We have rules about Joining/Merging tribes at your own risk for these purposes.

Dealing with the word “**nigga**” with the A
> We take bigotry very seriously here.  While we do not condone the use of the “gga” version of the word, we have had to accept that it is part of certain speech patterns used commonly.  If the person begins to use it in every single response or in a derogatory manner, we will reevaluate the situation

If a Player is being a total jerk and you are uncomfortable
> I am not able to help you with this issue.  I will see if another staff member is available.

# Types of Tickets

There are several kinds of tickets, we tend to break them up into 2 tiers.

# Type 1 

Moderators can usually resolve these via mediation, .timeout, or discussion.

Usually these just require a Staff member to walk the Player through the method slowly to figure out what they need to do, or what they did incorrectly. For arguments between players, Moderators are able to go into the map-chat and try to de-escalate the issue calmly. For Racism, usually you will use .timeout on the player's Discord id, and then immediately notify an Admin to see if it needs a ban. For shop issues, most of those are players rushing or being impatient. Walking through and checking will usually help. As for the Questions, most Moderators are already familiar with how to answer generalized ones.

- Player arguments.
- Arguments - in the chats, name calling, etc.
- Questions about upgrade/downgrade of tier subscriptions.
- Shop problems (situational)
- General questions about discord commands.

# Type 2 

Pretty much all of these will require an Admin, but Moderators are able to let Players know that staff is aware of their issue and an Admin will be with them shortly (this makes them feel like they are not being ignored). During this time, Mods can help out by ensuring that we have all the necessary info we will need such as GPS coordinates, tribe names, players involved, etc.

- Griefing (<span style="color: magenta;">PvE Only</span>)
- Structure Issue tickets (meshed in the ground, base is too big, base disappeared.)
- Dinos left on a base or public area, such as OB or CC. (<span style="color: magenta;">PvE Only</span>)
- Cheating accusations.
- Donations for VC.
- Platform/Obelisk purchases from the Donations tab.
- Gameplay settings issues, such as too many of a certain dino spawning, etc.
- Maps being down.

# Don't Jump to Conclusions

One of the largest issues we try to avoid (and try to dissuade others from doing), is rushing to conclusions on what happened, or the motives of the person involved. We need to acknowledge the issue first, then examine the information and do whatever investigation is necessary before we respond with a solution. This cuts down on misinformation, and makes sense we are being fair and unbiased to everyone.

# Closing Tickets

- Start by letting the user know if they no longer need assistance they can close with `.close [reason]`
- If no response for a while or it makes sense for you to close, you can close for them. 
  - For example, state the issue they and how it was resolved: `player had donation issue, transferred VC and registered correct account`
> MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE A DETAILED REASON
