# First Week
The first few days can be observatory, but should quickly turn into activity. At the least, you should be asking questions or viewing how the other Staff are handling things. You will want to grasp the flow of moderation quickly.

By the end of your first week, aim to have completed a minimum of three moderations.

You must touch base with Staff in some way at least every other day. This can be done via trial ticket, talking in Staff chat, or handling moderation.

> Consistent absence without communication, a lack of moderation activity or effort in learning, or disengagement with Staff and the Trial process in general may result in a recommendation for, or immediate removal from the Trial position. It's advisable to show heightened interest and maintain a high level of Staff-related activity throughout the two-week period and beyond.

# Second Week
The second week of Trial, it is assumed you have completed a few moderations already and are continuing to learn and integrate well with Staff. You should not use this as a time to relax, rather hone your skills and finish strong.

Look to have completed a minimum of six moderations by the end of the second week. This isnt a requirement but a recommendation.

> Even if you pass the two week requirements and are offered the full Mod position. Your activity will continue to matter. Acquiring full Mod and then proceeding to not perform any Moderation duties will result in removal all the same. Please ensure you will be active before applying and Trialing.
