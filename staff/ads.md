Sharing external Discord invites or inviting others to a different server is grounds for an immediate <span style="color: orange;">ban</span>. Our community is not a conduit for other servers, and exploiting it in this manner goes against the purpose of the server and is considered highly disrespectful. This includes indirect invites such as, "DM me to join my server." or urging others to join an alternative server within public channels.

> DM server invites are also prohibited if unsolicited.

However, sharing general artwork or other content (with discretion) is generally permitted and acceptable to post.
