In the event of arguments escalating into disrespectful comments, harassment, or insults, swift action must be taken to address the situation. The de-escalation approach may vary depending on the severity. For instances where a user persistently hurls insults at another, an immediate timeout may be the suitable initial step. It is generally advised to implement a minimum <span style="color: orange;">one-day timeout</span>, as after this period, the user is less likely to continue the argument.

For milder instances of disrespect, insults, or calling out another user (e.g., labeling someone as a poor player), a <span style="color: orange;">message deletion with a verbal warning</span> or a bot-issued <span style="color: orange;">warning</span> would be appropriate along with referring them to take things to `#pvp-general`. However, if the insults target a person's character or involve derogatory language, it is absolutely unacceptable. Using slurs or making derogatory remarks about someone's character warrants either a <span style="color: orange;">lengthy timeout</span> or a <span style="color: orange;">temp ban</span>, following the Hate Speech tiers in Discord Rule 1.1.

Reviving drama is prohibited, often happening when a third party inquires about a user or situation after a Moderator has already advised the chat to cease discussion on the matter. This normally leads to a <span style="color: orange;">timeout</span>, but a <span style="color: orange;">warning</span> should be issued beforehand.

> The use of profanity is generally allowed as long as its not excessive and not directed at anyone.
