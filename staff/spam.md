Channel descriptions serve as sub-rules, particularly in channels where specific issues may arise (such as members posting memes in the life channel). Familiarize yourself with these descriptions to ensure accurate moderations and judgments in the future.

Shitposting in `#general` or any other non-meme focused channel would constitute a <span style="color: orange;">message deletion</span> and a verbal warning or a bot issued <span style="color: orange;">warning</span>. Subsequent offenses or more serious violations will lead to a <span style="color: orange;">24-hour timeout</span> minimum.

There may be instances of persistent users or those posting extensive or copypasta messages. In such cases, it's advised to handle them with discretion and assess the intent behind the behavior.

Media, attachments, URLs, and GIFs are subject to automated moderation by the bot. The removed content is logged in the defender channel for reference. It's crucial to review this content as if no filter were in place, as it could have been exposed to a large number of members. Additionally, any attempts to bypass the filter should be met with a timeout or temp ban, depending on the severity and nature of the content being attempted to be posted.
