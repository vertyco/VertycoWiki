## 🤔 Overview

The common sense rules are base guidelines that all members should follow. They are explained here to prevent any internet armchair lawyers from wasting Staff's time.

## 🔑 Key Principles for Staff

### Rule Interpretation
- Server rules are not open to interpretation.
- Avoid debates with those attempting to find loopholes.
- For disruptive content, apply an appropriate punishment based on severity.

### Baiting & Language Policy
- Handle users baiting others into rule violations (e.g., soliciting Discord invites or eliciting prohibited language).
- Apply similar consequences as if the baited user broke the rule.
- Ensure members use English exclusively in public channels, as we lack sufficient bilingual Staff to moderate other languages.

### Account Responsibility
- All punishments issued against an account are final.
- Claims like "my brother used my account" are not valid excuses.
- Users are responsible for the security and good standing of their accounts.

### Staff Authority
- Staff have the final say on punishments placed against an account.
- Actions not specifically listed in the rules can still be punished if they are disruptive to the server's purpose.
- Evaluate severity, user intent, and exercise discretion when making punishment decisions.
