# Setting an Example

In all member interactions, aim to be a role model. The Staff culture extends to all members. This doesn't mean you can't reciprocate, but be mindful not to cross into rule-breaking territory or violate channel rules. Avoid actions that would warrant punishment if the Staff label wasn't in place.

# Direct Messages

Closing your direct messages is strongly advised. If you choose not to do so, please note that any interactions within them cannot be acted upon. User reports, evidence, etc., are only valid when submitted through a Ticket, where there is full Staff oversight on the situation.

# Staff Complaints

Complaints in Ticket that involve or mention another Staff member should not be addressed by the Staff member mentioned. This ensures a fair and unbiased handling of the situation. Both parties involved should provide evidence to support their side of the story.
