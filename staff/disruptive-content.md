NSFW/Disruptive content encompasses not only material unsuitable for a work environment like "porn-bait" memes, explicit nudity, etc., but also includes any disruptive content within a chat channel. This extends to sexual innuendos and inappropriate comments that disturb the conversation or environment in general.

All content within a user's profile as well as anything posted in the server must be safe for work, non offensive, and must be appropriate in general. Content posted is judged at Staff's discretion. Generally, anything questionable is best to be removed. If anything posted includes blatant nudity or NSFW (death, gore, etc.) it is to be a ban.

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Profile Images

The following content is not allowed in profiles. Note that this is not an extensive list.

- Nazism
- Nudity
- Shock content
- Extremist ideologies
- Abuse or violence

## Profile Content

The following content is not allowed in profiles. Note that this is not an extensive list.

- Links to malicious or spam Discord servers.
- Links or offerings of cheat services or exploits.
- Anything illegal or against the Discord terms of service or guideline

## Usernames

The following content is not allowed in profiles. Note that this is not an extensive list.

- Pronouns that spell or pronounce a slur.
- Any slurs against a person's race, sexual preference, etc.


<br>
For profile pictures that contain nudity, the user should be kicked requesting that their profile picture be changed before rejoining. Please double check when the user re-joins as the `#join-log` uses a cached version of the profile picture and not always the latest.


> Based on the age and activity of the account, you have the option to request the user, via Tickets or `.warn`, to replace any content that violates the rules instead of resorting to a punishment.

# Further Disruptive Content Outside of #pvp-general

Anything that could be considered trolling or disruptive should be removed and the user warned or muted depending on severity. This is of course at Moderator discretion, so the following examples may help:

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Example A
`User1: Fortnight is the greatest game of all time!`

`User2: Not true, why do you think that?`

`User1: Just is bozo, don't ask me any more questions.`

Likely trolling.

## Example B

`User1: WaW has the greatest zombies game ever.`

`User2: Not true, why would you say that?`

`User1: The gunplay is good, maps are fun, etc.`

Not trolling, just an non-common opinion. Identifying trolling requires effort in discerning whether it is such or not. If questionable, ask other Staff to check your judgement.
