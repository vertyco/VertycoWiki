# Helping With Ark Data Issues

Keep in mind that players often use different terminology for things like obelisk/terminal/upload ect... So make sure you understand what they're referring to.

# Player Can't See Their Data

If a player knows they should have something in their Ark data but cannot see it, you can use the .arkdata info command to give a short troubleshoot guide for resolving this bug. If none of those steps work, proceed below.

## Step 1: Checking Their Data Via Command

`.checkdata <player>`

> The `<player>` argument can be one of the following:
> • A user mention "<span style="color: skyblue;">@user</span>"
> • Discord ID
> • The person's Gamertag
> • The person's Xbox ID (XUID)
{.is-info}


<figure style="text-align: left;">
  <img src="/assets/checkdata-example.png" alt="Description" style="width: 50%; max-width: 600px;" />
  <figcaption style="color: #b9bbbe;">In this example the user is mentioned, This will only work if the player has registered via <span style="color: orange;">.register</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<figure style="text-align: left;">
  <img src="/assets/checkdata-example.png" alt="Description" style="width: 50%; max-width: 600px;" />
</figure>

> • If the cluster they're on isn't shown then there is <span style="color: red;">Nothing</span> in their Ark data.
• If the file size says <span style="color: orange;">0 bytes</span> then there is <span style="color: red;">Nothing</span> in their ark data.
