# Hard R vs n*gga

The hard R, if being used by anyone towards another is an <span style="color: orange;">instant ban</span> without question. However, If it was typed out as part of a rebuttal against being called that, we review the context and make a decision appropriate to the full intent of its usage. As long as they aren't using the fact that someone called them the hard R in order to say it in chat, we will just delete the message and warn them not to break [Rule 1.5](https://discord.com/channels/625757527765811240/725721196250923016/848162418235801631)

# *gga version

These days the word  *nigga* has become common tongue among gamers in the age demographic that play PvP in a way that is not conducive to racism or hate speech, therefore outright banning for language that is normal to some is not the best course of action. Instead causal use of this term is permitted as long as it is clearly not meant to be used in any derogatory way.
