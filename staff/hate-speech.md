# Hate Speech & Slurs Policy

Per the 2025 Update, we have moved away from permanent bans for most Discord offenses. Hate speech and slurs now follow a tiered temp ban system:

- **First Offense**: <span style="color: orange;">7-day temp ban</span>
- **Second Offense**: <span style="color: orange;">15-day temp ban</span>
- **Third Offense**: <span style="color: orange;">60-day temp ban</span>
- **Real-world threats, doxxing, or similar**: <span style="color: orange;">Permanent ban</span>

# Hard R vs Soft A

The hard R version, if being used towards another person in a derogatory manner, results in a <span style="color: orange;">temp ban</span> following the tiers above. However, if it was typed out as part of a rebuttal against being called that, we review the context and make a decision appropriate to the full intent of its usage. As long as they aren't using the fact that someone called them the hard R in order to say it in chat, we will just delete the message and warn them not to break Rule 1.5.

# Soft A Version

These days the word *nigga* has become common tongue among gamers in the age demographic that play PvP in a way that is not conducive to racism or hate speech, therefore outright banning for language that is normal to some is not the best course of action. Instead casual use of this term is permitted as long as it is clearly not meant to be used in any derogatory way.
