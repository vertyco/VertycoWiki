# 💰 Donations & Economy

Vertyco is primarily maintained through community donations, which help cover server costs and development time. This page explains our donation options and how our economy works.

<div style="margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px; background-color: rgba(46, 204, 113, 0.2); border-left: 4px solid #2ecc71; border-radius: 4px;">
  <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Not Pay-to-Win</h2>
  <p>Vertyco's shop system is deliberately designed to ensure free players can achieve better results than those who purchase items:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shop blueprints are capped at quality 5 for PvP (in-game drops can reach quality 10)</li>
    <li>Purchased dinosaurs have lower stats than those you can tame yourself in the wild</li>
    <li>All items available in the shop can be obtained through regular gameplay</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Donations support server costs while providing minor conveniences, not gameplay advantages.</p>
