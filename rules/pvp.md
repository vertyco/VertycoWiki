# ⚔️ PvP Rules & Procedures

> **Our Philosophy:**
> Ark PvP is a highly competitive and often toxic environment. We impose as few rules as possible to keep gameplay organic. Temporary bans, timeouts, and data wipes are our primary punishments. **Permanent bans are reserved for confirmed aimbotters/ESP users and severe real-world violations.**

## 🚫 Offenses That Still Result in Permanent Ban

- Confirmed Aimbot or ESP usage
- Filing a chargeback
- DDoS attacks or threats
- Doxxing (releasing private/personal information)
- Real-world threats of violence or harm (e.g., "I know where you live")

All other offenses will result in temporary bans, timeouts, wipes, or warnings as described below.

- **Temp Bans**: Most bans are now temporary. Only the most severe real-world violations (see above) will result in a permanent ban.
- **Toxicity**: Ark PvP is a toxic game by nature. We will only issue a permanent ban for hate speech if it involves real-world threats, doxxing, or similar. Otherwise, even the worst language (including slurs) will result in a temp ban of some sort.
