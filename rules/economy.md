# Real World Transactions

ANY attempts to sell, trade, or buy anything is a permanent ban. This does not include, for example:

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Example A

`User1: posts picture of some thing`

`User2: wow cool, where can I get that?`

`User1: I found it on eBay, <link>`

In this scenario, no one is directly engaging in selling, trading, or buying. This involves an exchange of information that would constitute an off-platform transaction, not directly associated with our members.

## Example B

`User1: who's trying to play my ark server, dm me for invite`

Despite no response, `User1` is to be <span style="color: orange;">banned</span> for attempting to poach members for their server, clearly they have their own server so there's no reason for them to stay other than to poach.

## Example C

`User1: Does anyone have a Discord account I can buy?`

`User2: Yes, dm me!`

In this example, both User1 and User2 are to be <span style="color: orange;">banned</span> for facilitating a transaction on the server. Account buying is also specifically against Discord ToS.

## Example D

`User1: Selling Carch eggs high dmg for $3 Paypal`

Despite no response, `User1` is to be <span style="color: orange;">banned</span> for attempting to facilitate a transaction on the server. Nobody should be paying or be paid to play the game.

## Example E
`User1: yeah just got some sick gear on Bams Ark`

`User2: hell yeah same here, tryina tribe up?`

`User1: sure thing hmu when you get on`

In this scenario no one is specifically poaching members, they both play on another server so its okay to mention it as long as they're not obviously trying to bring more members to it.

# Shameless Begging

Absolutely no begging for games, DLC, money, VC, or any form of labor is permitted. Likewise, soliciting payment for trades, whether sending or receiving, is strictly prohibited. Engaging in such activities will result in a <span style="color: orange;">ban</span>. In essence, the server is not to be used for any form of real world transactions.
